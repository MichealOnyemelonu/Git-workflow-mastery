#### This project is for the Devops bootcamp exercise for "Version Control" 

## This project demonstrates practical Git workflows and version control best practices essential for DevOps and Cloud roles. 
## It covers real-world scenarios such as branching strategies, merge conflicts, commit management, and collaboration using GitLab and GitHub

✅ Skills Demonstrated

Git fundamentals: clone, commit, push, pull
Branching strategies: feature, bugfix, and master
Merge requests and direct merges
Conflict resolution
Commit history management: revert and reset
.gitignore best practices
Remote repository management (GitLab & GitHub)


🛠 Tools Used

Git (CLI)
GitLab (primary remote)
GitHub (secondary remote)
Linux terminal


📂 Exercises Summary


Clone and Create Repository

Cloned a GitLab repo and pushed to a personal remote.



.gitignore Setup

Ignored unnecessary files (.idea, .DS_Store, out, build).



Feature Branch Workflow

Upgraded dependencies and added an image to index.html.



Bugfix Branch Workflow

Fixed spelling errors and pushed changes.



Merge Request

Merged feature branch into master via GitLab MR.



Merge Conflict Resolution

Resolved conflicts after merging master into bugfix branch.



Revert Commit

Reverted a pushed commit after team feedback.



Reset Commit

Undid a local commit using git reset.



Direct Merge

Merged bugfix branch into master using CLI.



Branch Cleanup

🌐 Why This Matters for DevOps
Version control is the backbone of modern DevOps workflows. This project demonstrates:

Collaboration: Working with multiple branches and merge requests.
Automation readiness: Git skills are essential for CI/CD pipelines.
Infrastructure as Code: GitOps relies on strong Git fundamentals.
