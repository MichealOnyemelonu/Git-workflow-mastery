.gitignore Setup

Ignored unnecessary files (.idea, .DS_Store, out, build).



Feature Branch Workflow

Upgraded dependencies and added an image to index.html.



Bugfix Branch Workflow

Fixed spelling errors and pushed changes.



Merge Request

Merged feature branch into master via GitLab MR.



Merge Conflict Resolution

Resolved conflicts after merging master into bugfix branch.



Revert Commit

🌐 Why This Matters for DevOps
Version control is the backbone of modern DevOps workflows. This project demonstrates:

Collaboration: Working with multiple branches and merge requests.
Automation readiness: Git skills are essential for CI/CD pipelines.
Infrastructure as Code: GitOps relies on strong Git fundamentals.
